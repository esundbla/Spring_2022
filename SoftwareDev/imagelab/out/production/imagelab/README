OBJECTIVE
ImageLab is a framework and application that allows student programmers
to develop image modification processors (filters) and to experience
the results visually and aurally.

The project uses Java as the programming language.

Images are preprocessed into 2-Dimensional arrays of pixels, corresponding to:
a RED channel (intensity of the color red associated with each pixel)
a GREEN channel (intensity of the color green associated with each pixel)
a BLUE channel (intensity of the color blue associated with each pixel)
a BW channel (intensity in greyscale values associated with each pixel)
an ALPHA channel (the amount of transparency associated each pixel)

An example of accessing and using those channels can be found in: filters/Generic.java

CONTENT ORGANIZATION
The ImageLab application is bundled in the jar file: imagelab.jar
Sample images are provided in the subdirectory named: images
Examples of image filter source code are provided in the subdirectory named: filters
---
HOW TO USE
Create Java source code for a new image filter based on the sample filter(s) provided.
Put the new filter's source code into the subdirectory named: filters
Compile filters using command: javac -cp .:imagelab.jar filters/*.java
Run ImageLab using command: java -cp .:imagelab.jar Run
